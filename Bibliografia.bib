abstract     = {<p>Continuous space language models have recently demonstrated outstanding
                results across a variety of tasks. In this paper, we examine the vector-space
                word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We
                find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and
                semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by
                a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on
                the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is
                automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King - Man +
                Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word
                vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions
                (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40{\%} of the
                questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regularities by
                using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions.
                Remarkably, this method outperforms the best previous systems.</p>},

We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}

	journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research},

	abstract = {We present a new technique called {\textquotedblleft}t-SNE{\textquotedblright} that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces signi\&$\#$64257;cantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to in\&$\#$64258;uence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are signi\&$\#$64257;cantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets.},
